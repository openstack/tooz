    The ``etcd3gw`` driver now automatically discovers available etcd API
    version and determines the api path. The driver detects the appropriate api
    path before sending its first request, and the path is reused for its
    subsequent requests. Services may need to be restarted after its backend
    etcd server is upgraded, so that the new api path is detected.
    The detection is skipped if the coordination backend url contains
    the ``api_version`` query parameter or the ``ETCD3GW_API_PATH``
    environment is set.
