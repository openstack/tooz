features:
  - |
    The redis driver now supports the following options.

    - ``sentinel_username``
    - ``sentinel_parameters``
    - ``sentinel_ssl``

fixes:
  - |
    The redis driver no longer enables authentication for redis sentinel when
    authentication is enabled in redis. This was the previous behavior before
    6.0.0, and was already required by some deployment tools like kolla. Now
    authentication for redis sentinel is controlled by a separate options
    (``sentinel_username`` and ``sentinel_password``).

  - |
    The redis driver no longer enables SSL for redis sentinel when SSL is
    enabled in redis, to restore the compatibility with older versions. Now
    SSL for redis sentinel is controlled by the separate ``sentinel_ssl``
    option.
