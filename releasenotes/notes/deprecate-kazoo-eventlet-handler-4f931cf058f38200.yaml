deprecations:

    Eventlet usages are deprecated and the removal of Eventlet from
    OpenStack `is planned <https://governance.openstack.org/tc//goals/proposed/remove-eventlet.html>`_,
    for this reason, using the ``eventlet`` handler from kazoo
    available into  the zookeeper driver is now deprecated. The support of
    Eventlet will be soon removed from tooz.

    Please start considering removing your internal Eventlet usages and
    start migrating your stack.
